          <p class="lead">My disclaimer is that I am a very average NBA 2K player. I win about half of my games online. My offensive sets include 5-out (where everyone sits around and waits for the ball at the three point line on offense) and I change my defensive settings to “drive help &amp; no rotation.” I also set the on ball defensive settings to tight coverage.</p>

          <p>For the 1965 Boston Celtics team, I chose not to run 5-out on offense because there was no 3 point line back in 1965 (the NBA three point line was established on October 12th, 1979). Therefore, I ran the default offense of the 1965 Boston Celtics.</p>

          <p>K.C Jones is a solid point guard, but shooting with him is quite difficult because of his shot timing. K.C can get to the rim and finish, but he’s not a primary option on offense. At the 2 spot, we got Sam Jones. Sam can drive to the lane and get layups, but again, this team was not designed for the 3 point shot.</p>

          <p>At the 3 spot, the default starter for small forward is Tom “Satch” Sanders. He gets the rim, finishes layups, and is one of my top 2 options for offense on this team. Satch won 8 NBA championships and is really fun to play with in 2K – he is my #1 scoring option on this team.</p>

          <p>For the 4 spot, the default starter is Tom Heinsohn. He gets his rebounds, but he doesn’t produce much offense. My recommendation here is to start John “Hondo” Havlicek – two small forwards in the starting lineup. Also, Hondo is the only guy on this team that I recommend shooting 3 pointers with. </p>

          <p>At the center position, the default starter is the all time great Bill Russell – give him as many minutes as possible and change the offensive settings to “crash offensive glass” because Bill Russell will grab a ton of offensive boards for you.</p>

          <p>Overall, my review of this team is that they play amazing defense, but this team has a very difficult trading buckets on the offensive end. Basically, it becomes difficult and frustrating to contend in a game trading 3 point buckets for 2 point buckets.</p>

          <p>My preferred starting lineup online would be KC Jones, Sam Jones, John “Hondo” Havlicek, Tom “Satch” Sanders, and Bill Russell. This lineup packs an offensive punch and their defense is ridiculously good, but getting consistent 3 point buckets with this team has been a huge mystery for me. Overall, I’ve only won two games with this team online, but it’s always fun to go back into basketball history and hoop it up online.</p>
